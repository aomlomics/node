# To run using Docker:

Build the image and run the image in a container using

```bash
docker build -t opal -f server/Dockerfile.dev .; docker run -t -d -p 8080:8080 --name opal opal
```

This will open our remote server at `localhost:8080`. After running this once, you can use Docker Desktop to manage the container.

To delete the container and image, use

```bash
docker rm --force opal; docker rmi opal
```

To open the container in VSCode, open the Command Pallette `ctrl + shift + p` and run `Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container` (this requires the Dev Containers extension).

Open the folder `/app/Opal/server` in the Dev Container.

When opening the first time, VSCode will think every file has been changed (potentially line-termination inconsistencies, not sure). Discard all git changes before starting any work. You should only have to do this once after creating the container.

# server

The server must be handled inside the Docker container.

To reattach your terminal to the gunicorn process, use

```bash
screen -rd opalserver
```

To scroll inside the screen (enter copy mode), hit `ctrl+a`, then hit `esc`. When you are in copy mode, you can't see new logs. So, once you are done looking, hit `ctrl+c` to exit copy mode. To detach, hit `ctrl+a`, then hit `d`.

There are helpful `.sh` scripts you can run with the `bash` command in `server/scripts`.
The `restart.sh` script will restart the gunicorn process to allow you to view changes to code.
The `start.sh` script will run the gunicorn process in a screen. Behavior is the same as when you run `attach.sh`.

# vercel

The front-end must be handled outside of the Docker container.

## Helpful commands

All of these commands must be executed from inside `/vercel`.

Install all node dependencies from package.json

```bash
npm install
```

Run the local test server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the Prisma database view

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Push schema changes to database (all database migrations should be done in `/vercel`)

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name <insert migration name>
```

Pull schema changes from database (must be done in `/server` after creating a migration in `/vercel`)

```bash
prisma db pull
```

Generate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

To create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the current version of the database, copy and paste the contents of the schema.dbml file in `prisma/dbml` to: [DB Diagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d)
