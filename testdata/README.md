# Test data for Opal

The following files are used to populate the Opal database:

- `metadata.xlsx` (from Miwa's R script or similar -- need to add NOAA-specific fields)
- `manifest.csv` (sample names and "absolute" paths to fastq files -- most important is filename and parent run directory)
- `pe_trim_man_full_nb-asv_taxa_sample_table.txt` (asv table from Tourmaline)
- `config-01-sample.yaml`, `config-02-repseqs.yaml`, `config-03-taxonomy.yaml` (3 config files for Tourmaline run)
